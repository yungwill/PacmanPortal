# PacmanPortal

Project where the class had to recreate Pacman and add the portal ability from the game Portal.
I was unable to get the portal ability to work at all.
Completion Time: 2 1/2 Weeks
All programming was done with no previous experience in Python except what was learned in the CPSC 386 class.

Bugs/Problems/Not Implemented:
  - Didn't implement portal ability
  - Pacman partially went through the wall
  - Ghosts moved randomly rather than in patterns
