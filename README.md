# PacmanPortal

Project where the class had to recreate Pacman and add the portal ability from the game Portal.
I was unable to get the portal ability to work at all.

Bugs/Problems/Not Implemented:
  - Didn't implement portal ability
  - Pacman partially went through the wall
  - Ghosts moved randomly rather than in patterns
